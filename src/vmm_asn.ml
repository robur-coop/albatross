(* please read this before changing this module:

   Data encoded by this module is persisted in (a) dump file and
   (b) certificates (and subCA). It is important to be aware of backward and
   forward compatibility when modifying this module. There are various version
   fields around which are mostly useless in retrospect. On a server deployment,
   upgrades are supported while downgrades are not (there could be a separate
   tool reading newer data and dumping it for older albatross versions). The
   assumption is that a server deployment moves forward. For the clients, older
   clients should best be support smoothly, or an error from the server should
   be issued informing about a too old version. Clients which support newer
   wire version should as well be notified (it may be suitable to have a
   --use-version command-line flag - so new clients can talk to old servers).

   It should be ensured that old unikernels dumped to disk (a) can be read by
   new albatross daemons. The functions unikernels_to_cstruct and
   unikernels_of_cstruct are used for dump and restore, each an explicit choice.
   They use the trie of unikernel_config, dump always uses the latest version in
   the explicit choice. There's no version field involved.

   The data in transit (certificates and commands) is out of control of a single
   operator. This means that best effort should be done to support old clients
   (and old servers - eventually with a command-line argument --use-version). If
   a server receives a command (via TLS cert_extension), this is prefixed by a
   version. The non-TLS command is a sequence of header and payload, where the
   header includes a version. At the moment, the commands are all explicit
   choices, adding new ones by extending the choice works in a
   backwards-compatible way.
*)

(* The version field could be used (at the moment, decoding a newer version
   leads to a decoding failure):

   Now, to achieve version-dependent parsing, what is missing is a way to decode
   the first element of a sequence only (i.e. treat the second element as
   "any"). This is something missing for PKCS12 from the asn1 library. A
   "quick hack" is to extract length information of the first element, and use
   that decoder on the sub-buffer. The following implements this. *)

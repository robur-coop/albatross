  Ed25519 (used to be RSA) (@hannesm)
- use happy-eyeballs for name resolution and connection setup (@hannesm)
- converge albatross-client-* semantics (@hannesm)
- Implement block_set and block_dump subcommands, also block_add is extended

  on http://builds.robur.coop (a repository of reproducible built unikernels)
  (c) does a unikernel update (with same arguments and configuration)

# v2.5.0 (2025-08-14)

* Console: fix an out of memory issue (reading lines) reported by @edwintorok,
  now only the first 512 bytes of each line is displayed, the rest is dropped
* Update: accept old_unikernel_info{2,3} replies (#210 @hannesm)
* Streaming unikernels and block devices:
  Instead of providing unikernel images and block device data as a big blob in
  memory (or the certificate), these commands now work in streaming mode:
   - TLS endpoint upon receiving a Unikernel_{force_}create if the image is the
     empty string, it reads data on the TLS flow (everything chunked with a 4
     byte length prefix, until a 0 chunk is received) #211 @reynir @hannesm
   - Block_set as well carries the data as a stream on the communication channel
     - please note this is carried forward from the TLS endpoint to albatrossd
   - Block_dump delivers the block data as a stream
     (of `Block_data of string option)

# v2.0.0 (2023-05-14)

This is a breaking release since the binaries to be installed have been revised
and merged. The `albatross-client-local` is now `albatross-client [--socket]`,
`albatross-provision-ca` is now `albatross-client sign` or `albatross-client
generate`. The `albatross-client-remote` is now `albatross-client certificate`.
The `albatross-client-bistro` is now `albatross-client <command>
--destination <host> --ca ca.pem --ca-key ca.pem --server-ca cacert.pem`.

And finally, `albatross-tls-inetd` is now `albatross-tls-endpoint --inetd`.

- Improve error messages when socket binding fails, and when albatross-console
  is not running (#139, inspired by #137, @hannesm @samoht)
- Debian packages: add gmp and libnl package dependencies (#141 #142 @reynir
  @hannesm)

  but not the same one (@hannesm)
- tls-endpoint: listen on systemd socket, add systemd example (#119 @Julow
  @reynir)

  @reynir @hannesm)
- Add deployment scripts for nixos (#120 @Julow)

# v1.5.1 (2022-08-31)

- Albatross_influx: drop leading ':' if path should be dropped (#114 @hannesm)

- Refactor albatross BHyve stat collection (to avoid exception in List.combine)
  (#116 @reynir @hannesm)
- Albatross-client-update: adapt URLs to current builder-web deployment (#117
  @hannesm)
- Albatross-client: allow passing a mac address explicitly to create for each
  network interface (#107 @reynir)

# v1.5.0 (2022-05-16)

- Revise Name.t to use ':' as path separation, and allow '.' in labels.
  Previously the path was built by the common name in the X.509 certificate
  chain and the leaf certificate was appended (i.e. chain certificate "foo",
  chain certificate "bar", leaf certificate "my.unikernel" lead to the name
  "foo.bar.my.unikernel" -- and chain certificate "foo", leaf "bar.my.unikernel"
  lead to the identical name). Since the holder of the certificate and private
  key "foo" could issue at any point another intermediate certificate for "bar",
  this is not security critical -- but for resource management this was
  confusing and lead to some issues (policy could be violated).
  Now, the path separator is ':' (i.e. "foo:bar:my.unikernel" and
  "foo:bar.my.unikernel").
  In addition, various test cases have been added, for vmm_trie, vmm_resources
  and also for old and new wire versions (albatross daemon state, command
  execution) to ensure that old clients continue to work with new server
  components. The wire version has been bumped to WV5, since the Name.t encoding
  was changed. (#111, @hannesm @reynir)
- systemd: fifo are created by albatross_daemon (not albatross_console) (#106,
  @reynir)
- systemd: cleanup, use group albatross, (#108, fixes #105, @reynir)
- documentation: remove solo5-elftool requirement -- since 1.4.0
  ocaml-solo5-elftool is used (#109 @hannesm)
- CI execute tests (#112, @hannesm)
- fix URL to builder-web (https://builds.robur.coop) which dropped the
  opam-switch postfix in the URL (#113 @hannesm)
- albatross-client-local, albatross-client-bistro: support remote (socket/host)
  '-' to output the command as hexdump (PEM file) on standard output (@hannesm)

# v1.4.3 (2022-03-15)

# v1.4.2 (2022-02-04)

- fix issues "use OCaml solo5-elftool instead of binary" where the compressed
  unikernel image was passed to the tool (if albatross-provision-request was
  used, and in albatross-daemon) (#101 by @palainp, fixed in #102 by @hannesm)
